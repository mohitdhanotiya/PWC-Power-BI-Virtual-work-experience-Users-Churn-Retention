- Churn Rate = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes")/COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID])
- % churn by onlinesecurity = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[OnlineSecurity]="Yes")/COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID])
- % churn by Paperless billing = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[PaperlessBilling]="Yes")/COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Custom])
- % churn by PhoneService = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[PhoneService]="Yes")/COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID])

- % Dependents = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]="Yes")/COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID])
- % Partner = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Partner]="Yes")/COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID])
